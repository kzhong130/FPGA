# FPGA

#### Stopwatch
- This project aims to implement a stopwatch function on the FPGA board with functions like stop, start and restart.

#### CPU
- This is a simulator of CPU on the FPGA board, which can read instructions from the memory of FPGA, exectue them and show the results on the LED.

#### Pipeline-CPU
- This is also a simulator of CPU on the FPGA board but with the pipeline machnism to support data hazard.
